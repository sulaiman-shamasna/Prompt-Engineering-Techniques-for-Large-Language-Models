    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing natural language prompts to effectively extract desired information from large language models (LLMs) without retraining or fine-tuning them. With LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 showing strong capabilities in many NLP tasks, prompt engineering has emerged as an essential practice to enhance their performance by leveraging their embedded knowledge. In this guide, we will cover key prompt engineering methods, each tailored for different types of NLP challenges, and support them with examples and code to demonstrate their effectiveness."

    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional methods that require intensive retraining, prompt engineering enables LLMs to handle diverse tasks by modifying the way instructions are presented. Whether it's answering questions, performing logical reasoning, or solving mathematical problems, crafting an effective prompt can make a significant difference in model performance.\n",
